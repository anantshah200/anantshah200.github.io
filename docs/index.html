A rudimentary website to chronicle some of my struggles through this thing known as research. <br/> <br/>

I am a fifth year PhD student in the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/">Computer Science</a> department at Northwestern University, extremely fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://bengolub.net/">Prof. Benjamin Golub</a> and <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Prof. Jason Hartline</a>. My current areas of interest are Social and Economic Networks,  Mechanism Design and  Online Algorithms. <br/> <br/>

My curriculum vitae is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NSzbYJjyDPEgbgwvEfa5Rqj_1lZYrKad/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
